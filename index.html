			<h1 id="mainHeader">Careers paths I've taken</h1>
			
			<p>
				I've pinballed between a couple different careers in 2 short years.  I've gone from carpentry, to celltower technician,
				and currently trying to get into software development.  I'm lucky to have been able to figure out what career I wanted 
				while I'm young. At the same time I've been able to gain valuable experience in two vary different fields that most people wouldn't have.

					<h2>Carpentry</h2>
					<p> 
							I started an interest in carpentry after my basement had flooded and we re-did the floors. I had stopped doing any schoolwork
							entirely seeing it as unnecessary to the field, which was a bad decision. At 16 I had joined a vocational school for their building
							construction program. I was in the program for two years and received a heavy machinery certification and an OSHA 10 safety certification.
							After graduating I worked as a general laborer for 2 months at a historic renovation company in Saint Louis before being let go.

					<h2>Tower Technician</h2>
					<p> 
						After losing my job as a laborer, I called a buddy and had gotten a job as a celltower technician within the hour.
						I trained for three days on job safety and the equipment I would be using.  The first couple weeks were spent on the ground,
						in a shelter, setting up the electrical and server side of the tower we were working on in Kansas City.  I spent 3 days actually climbing a tower in
						Jeff City before realizing I was not cut out for the job's physical intensity.

				<section> <!-- Software Development section -->
					<h2>Software Development</h2>
					<p> 
						I decided to go to college for software development after climbing.  I figured given my childhood around technology
						would help me flourish more in that environment than the other two.  I moved to fenton and went to Saint Louis Community College for two semesters.
						once college became too expensive I moved back to Saint Clair and finally Sullivan to save some money for college.  Eventually, I signed
						up for the LaunchCode class to try and jumpstart myself into the field, so I could afford to finish my degree in night classes.
