			<h1 id="mainHeader">Careers paths I've taken</h1>
			
			<p>
				I've pinballed between a couple different careers in 2 short years.  I've gone from carpentry, to celltower technician,
				and currently trying to get into software development.  I'm lucky to have been able to figure out what career I wanted 
				while I'm young. At the same time I've been able to gain valuable experience in two vary different fields that most people wouldn't have.

					<p> <!-- Currently filler text -->
							I started an interest in carpentry after my basement had flooded and we re-did the floors. I had stopped doing any schoolwork
							entirely seeing it as unnecessary to the field, which was a bad decision. At 16 I had joined a vocational school for their building
							construction program. I was in the program for two years and received a heavy machinery certification and an OSHA 10 safety certification.
							After graduating I worked as a general laborer for 2 months at a historic renovation company in Saint Louis before being let go.
